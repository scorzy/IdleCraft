# IdleCraft

IdleCraft is an idle/incremental game inspired by Melvor and The Elder Scrolls.  
It focuses on skills such as woodcutting, mining, and crafting, with offline progression, simple quests, and local saves.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This is an early build. Many features are placeholders, the game is not balanced, and content is subject to change.
